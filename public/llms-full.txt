# Reway — Full Site Summary

Reway is a calm bookmarking workspace that transforms noisy links into a structured library. It focuses on fast capture, clean organization, and efficient navigation for people who save a lot of research and inspiration.

## Product overview
Reway helps you drop in messy notes and extracts the links automatically. The system enriches each entry with titles and preview metadata so your library stays readable and searchable.

## Core features
- **Smart Link Extraction**: Paste raw text or notes. Reway pulls every link so you can capture multiple bookmarks in one go.
- **Groups**: Keep research, inspiration, and builds separated with labeled groups and smart counts.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Move through bookmarks with arrow keys, preview instantly, and act without touching the mouse.
- **Flexible View Modes**: Switch between card, list, and icon layouts to fit the amount of context you need.

## Browser extension
- **Instant capture**: Save the current page directly from Chrome (Manifest V3).
- **Group workflows**: Open bookmark groups from the extension (with safe staggered popup fallback).
- **Duplicate detection**: Clear duplicate actions, including allowing duplicates across different groups.

## Dashboard workflows
- **Bulk selection**: Select multiple bookmarks and perform fast actions.
- **Optimistic group deletion**: Delete groups with cascade removal of bookmarks plus undo.
- **Group name limits**: 18-character limit with inline character counter.

## Motion, performance, and accessibility
- **Reduced-motion support**: Guards across landing, auth, legal pages, and dashboard interactions.
- **Animation tuning**: Shorter, stricter durations and removal of prohibited tracking utilities.
- **Accessibility**: Improved ARIA/accessible names for icon-only controls and toggles.

## Social previews
- **Dynamic OpenGraph images**: Clean per-page OG routes (for example: `/about/api/og`, `/privacy/api/og`, `/terms/api/og`).
